# iLocus
It is a project which uses strength of Wi-Fi Signals to localize a area. 4 WiFi routers are setup at each corner of the grid. The given area (5.4mX5.4m) is divided into 9 cells. Each cell has a dimension of (1.8m X 1.8m). Using Ti CC3200 module the strength of signals are measured at each cell and is stored in a database. Using algorithms such as K Nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks the data is clssified. Then the cell is detected according to the signal strength from each of the router.
